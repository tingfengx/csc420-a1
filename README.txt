Since you are here, you should have already unzipped
the Assignment 1 folder...

To run my code, ```cd``` into the ```Assignment 1``` 
folder, and run ```jupyter notebook```. The notebook 
containing my code is named ```a1_code.ipynb```. All 
my code for this assignment is inside this ipython 
notebook, and all code inside are clearly labeled for 
which question they were answering.
